* [**A Search Field Element With Dropdown for Suggestions From Static Data**](https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016/assignment-1-spec/blob/master/README-SEARCH-SUGGESTION-DROPDOWN.md)

For this assignment, we were given a list of 50,000 names and identification numbers as a string separated by certain delimiters. Our task was to build a search field element that would dynamically search the list as the user enters new input and display the found data in a drop-down.

For my bonus section for the project, I additionally created a function to sort the list by the ID number of the person in the query.

All of the code is interchangeable, and a new list of names with different delimiters could easily be passed in and sorted as well.
