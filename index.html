        <p>This project site was created for our first homework assignment for Web Advanced: Javascript in Fall 2016 at Parsons School of Design</p>

<h2>
<a id="search-field-element-with-suggestions-drop-down" class="anchor" href="#search-field-element-with-suggestions-drop-down" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Search Field Element with Suggestions Drop-Down</h2>

<p>For this assignment, we were given a list of 50,000 names and identification numbers as a string separated by certain delimiters. Our task was to build a search field element that would dynamically search the list as the user enters new input and display the found data in a drop-down.</p>

<p>For my bonus section for the project, I additionally created a function to sort the list by the ID number of the person in the query.</p>

<p>All of the code is interchangeable, and a new list of names with different delimiters could easily be passed in and sorted as well. </p>

<h2>
<a id="for-next-time" class="anchor" href="#for-next-time" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>For Next Time</h2>

<p>The code runs a bit slowly for the first inputs (since it is such a long list) and I am looking into different search methods (such as binary search) to speed it up at the beginning.</p>
