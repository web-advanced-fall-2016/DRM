Our task was to build a search field element that would dynamically search the list as the user enters new input and display the found data in a drop-down.\r\n\r\nFor my bonus section for the project, I additionally created a function to sort the list by the ID number of the person in the query.\r\n\r\nAll of the code is interchangeable, and a new list of names with different delimiters could easily be passed in and sorted as well. \r\n\r\n![page screenshot](https://danamartensmfadt.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/mfadtmostwanted.png)\r\n\r\n## For Next Time\r\n\r\nThe code runs a bit slowly for the first inputs (since it is such a long list) and I am looking into different search methods (such as binary search) to speed it up at the beginning.\r\n\r\nYou can find more about the specific assignment here:\r\n* [**A Search Field Element With Dropdown for Suggestions From Static Data**](https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016/assignment-1-spec/blob/master/README-SEARCH-SUGGESTION-DROPDOWN.md)\r\n \r\n",
